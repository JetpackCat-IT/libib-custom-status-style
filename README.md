# Libib custom status indicator style

A simple UserScript for customization of Libib.com status indicator

## Why did I make this?

Libib.com is a great website to keep track of your collection of books, CDs and other things.
Unfortunately the status indicator's color selection is not great and this make it hard to see if you already read a book or not.\
Here you can see a before and after:\
